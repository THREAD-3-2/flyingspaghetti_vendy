To demonstrate the present example, a primitive MATLAB code is developed
and is present in :mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy`.

:mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy`

The following are the important files in the
:mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy` module that contains the source code:

:mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy.main`

Final plots after the evaluation (Total mechanical energy, deformed
shapes and displacement vs.time) are provided by:

:mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy.plots`
	
The input data is give in:

:mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy.Flying_spaghetti`

The rest of the auxiliary files are required for the evaluation of the
problem while the all other parameters can be modified within the input
file “Flying_spaghetti”.
