To demonstrate the present example, a primitive MATLAB code is developed
and is present in :mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy`.

.. mat:automodule:: flyingspaghetti_vendy

The following are the important files in the
:mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy` module that contains the source code:

.. mat:autofunction:: flyingspaghetti_vendy.main

Final plots after the evaluation (Total mechanical energy, deformed
shapes and displacement vs.time) are provided by:

.. mat:autofunction:: flyingspaghetti_vendy.plots
	
The input data is give in:

.. mat:autofunction:: flyingspaghetti_vendy.Flying_spaghetti

the rest of the auxilary files are required for the evaluation of the
problem while the all other parameters can be modified within the input
file “Flying_spaghetti”.
