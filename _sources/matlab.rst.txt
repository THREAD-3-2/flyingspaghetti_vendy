To demonstrate the present example, a primitive MATLAB code is developed
and is present in :mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy`.
The input data is give in:

:mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy.src.bin.Flying_spaghetti`

The main execution file is in
:mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy.src` that contains the source code:

:mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy.main`

Final plots after the evaluation (Total mechanical energy, deformed
shapes and displacement vs.time) are provided by:

:mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy.plots`

The rest of the auxiliary files in :mod:`flyingspaghetti_vendy.src.bin`. They are required for the evaluation of the problem while the all other parameters can be modified within the input file. Upon execution, the norm of residual and norm of corrections corresponding to each iteration and each time step is shown in the command window. In the end the final results in the form of plots are executed.
