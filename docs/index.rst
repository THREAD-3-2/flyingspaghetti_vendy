Welcome to flyingspaghetti_vendy's documentation!
=================================================

`flyingspaghetti_vendy <https://github.com/THREAD-3-2/flyingspaghetti_vendy>`_
is a MATLAB code for the velocity based finite element formulation for the geometrically exact beam elements. The algebra of quaternions is employed for expressing the three-dimensional rotations while the primary interpolated variables are velocities in fixed frame and angular velocities in moving frame. The proposed time discretization of governing equations directly relates the energy conservation constraint with the time-discrete kinematic compatibility equations. The main advantage of the proposed method is in its simplicity, robustness and long-term stability.
